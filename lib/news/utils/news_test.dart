    title: 'E-Trade mulls booting meme stock trader Roaring Kitty: WSJ',

        '''Online brokerage platform E*Trade is reportedly considering removing GameStop (GME) meme stock trader Keith Gill, known as “Roaring Kitty,” off its platform over concerns of potential stock manipulation.
    
    Before Gill suddenly returned to X last month — which sent shares in GameStop surging — he bought a large volume of GME options on E*Trade. Some of these expired that week and likely netted him a profit, The Wall Street Journal reported on June 3, citing people familiar with the matter.
    
    The firm and its owner, Morgan Stanley, are concerned Gill can use his influence to pump GME for his benefit and are debating whether recent posts on X and Reddit could be considered manipulation, the sources said.
    
    They’re also worried removing him could draw negative attention to it and others might close their E*Trade account in solidarity with Gill. No decision has been made and the firms could decide to do nothing, the Journal reported.
    
    On May 13, Gill — a trader cited as a major influence on the 2021 meme stock rally and GameStop short squeeze — began cryptically posting to X for the first time in three years, sending meme stocks and meme coins surging.
    
    Weeks later on June 2, Gill posted to Reddit for the first time since 2021 to share a screenshot apparently showing he’s holding 181.4 million worth of GME stock and call options betting that GME would be at least 20 a share on June 21.
    
    GME rallied over 19% in Sunday night trading after Gill’s post. On Monday, June 3, it closed up 21% at 28 and climbed nearly 8.5% in after-hours trading to 30.36. according to Google Finance.''',
